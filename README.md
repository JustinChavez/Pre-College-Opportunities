# Welcome!
Bunch of opportunities for high school students that I wish I knew about before. Most are within the STEM field and are during summer 2017. I try to only include opportunities that pay you, are free, or are highly substidized. 

Please add any more opportunities you know about! The more the merrier!

For any questions or updates you can email me here: juscha1@umbc.edu
